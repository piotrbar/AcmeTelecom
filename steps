reflection vs. refactoring calllog to new component
who should decide start time?

CallStart and CallEnd deprecated - we now just use Call class for tracking active calls and completed calls.

BillingSystem originally responsible for storing call history, creating and terminating new calls, and calculating bills. We want separation of responsibility.
We created CallTracker class for tracking active calls and saving completed calls to the new CallLog class (interface as we may want different implementations, e.g. in-memory list based vs database etc.)
Biller class responsible for calculating tariffs (strategy pattern?)
To maintain backwards compatibility BillingSystem class keeps methods but they are just hooks to CallTracker/Biller methods.
